# HBNB Console

The HBNB Console is a command line interpreter that manages your AirBnB clone objects. This application allows you to create new objects (ex: User, Place), retrieve an object from a file, a database etc., do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.), update attributes of an object, and destroy an object.

## Features

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc.
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Installation

To install the HBNB Console, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gulrah/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git
cd holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

## Usage

To launch the console application, navigate to the application directory and type `./console.py` or `python3 console.py` in your terminal. The prompt `(hbnb)` should appear, indicating that the console is running.

## Commands

The console supports various commands for data management:

**create**: Creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id. `Usage: create <class name>`

**show**: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id. `Usage: show <class name> <id>`

**all**: Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. `Usage: all or all <class name>`

**update**: Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). `Usage: update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"`

**quit or EOF**: Exit the console
